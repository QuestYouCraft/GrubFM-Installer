## What's this?
This is the repository of the program that installs the [file manager from a1ive](https://github.com/a1ive/grub2-filemanager), based on the boot loaders Grub4Dos and Grub2 and is suitable for running in BIOS and UEFI-like systems (including UEFI + Secure Boot), and also makes your portable disk multiboot (i.e. after installing on it can write files that are also capable of loading in BIOS-like systems, for example, several ISO images with different operating systems).
